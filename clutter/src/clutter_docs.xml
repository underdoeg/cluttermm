<signal name="ClutterActor::allocation-changed">
<description>
The ::allocation-changed signal is emitted when the
#ClutterActor:allocation property changes. Usually, application
code should just use the notifications for the :allocation property
but if you want to track the allocation flags as well, for instance
to know whether the absolute origin of @actor changed, then you might
want use this signal instead.

<signal name="ClutterActor::destroy">
<description>
The ::destroy signal notifies that all references held on the

This signal might result in the finalization of the #ClutterActor
if all references are released.

Composite actors and actors implementing the #ClutterContainer
interface should override the default implementation of the
class handler of this signal and call clutter_actor_destroy() on
their children. When overriding the default class handler, it is
required to chain up to the parent's implementation.

<description>
The ::paint signal is emitted each time an actor is being painted.

Subclasses of #ClutterActor should override the #ClutterActorClass.paint

&lt;warning&gt;It is strongly discouraged to connect a signal handler to
the #ClutterActor::paint signal; if you want to change the paint
sequence of an existing #ClutterActor instance, either create a new
#ClutterActor class and override the #ClutterActorClass.paint virtual

The actor should paint its shape using the passed @pick_color.

<signal name="ClutterActor::queue-redraw">
<description>
The ::queue_redraw signal is emitted when clutter_actor_queue_redraw()
is called on @origin.

The default implementation for #ClutterActor chains up to the
parent actor and queues a redraw on the parent, thus &quot;bubbling&quot;
the redraw queue up through the actor graph. The default
implementation for #ClutterStage queues a clutter_stage_ensure_redraw()
in a main loop idle handler.

Note that the @origin actor may be the stage, or a container; it
does not have to be a leaf node in the actor graph.

Toolkits embedding a #ClutterStage which require a redraw and
relayout cycle can stop the emission of this signal using the
GSignal API, redraw the UI and then call clutter_stage_ensure_redraw()
themselves, like:

|[
static void
on_redraw_complete (gpointer data)
{
ClutterStage *stage = data;

/ * execute the Clutter drawing pipeline * /
clutter_stage_ensure_redraw (stage);
}

static void
on_stage_queue_redraw (ClutterStage *stage)
{
/ * this prevents the default handler to run * /
g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (stage, &quot;queue-redraw&quot;);

/ * queue a redraw with the host toolkit and call
* a function when the redraw has been completed
* /
queue_a_redraw (G_CALLBACK (on_redraw_complete), stage);
}
]|

&lt;note&gt;&lt;para&gt;This signal is emitted before the Clutter paint
pipeline is executed. If you want to know when the pipeline has
been completed you should connect to the ::paint signal on the
Stage with g_signal_connect_after().&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/note&gt;

<signal name="ClutterActor::queue-relayout">
<description>
The ::queue_layout signal is emitted when clutter_actor_queue_relayout()
is called on an actor.

The default implementation for #ClutterActor chains up to the
parent actor and queues a relayout on the parent, thus &quot;bubbling&quot;
the relayout queue up through the actor graph.

The main purpose of this signal is to allow relayout to be propagated
properly in the procense of #ClutterClone actors. Applications will
not normally need to connect to this signal.

<function name="clutter_actor_allocate_preferred_size">
<description>
Allocates the natural size of @self.

This function is a utility call for #ClutterActor implementations
that allocates the actor's preferred natural size. It can be used
by fixed layout managers (like #ClutterGroup or so called
'composite actors') inside the ClutterActor::allocate
implementation to give each child exactly how much space it
requires, regardless of the size of the parent.

This function is not meant to be used by applications. It is also
not meant to be used outside the implementation of the
#ClutterActorClass.allocate virtual function.

<function name="clutter_actor_animate">
<description>
Animates the given list of properties of @actor between the current
value for each property and a new final value. The animation has a
definite duration and a speed given by the @mode.

For example, this:

|[
clutter_actor_animate (rectangle, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 250,
&quot;width&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;height&quot;, 100.0,
NULL);
]|

will make width and height properties of the #ClutterActor &quot;rectangle&quot;
grow linearly between the current value and 100 pixels, in 250 milliseconds.

The animation @mode is a logical id, either from the #ClutterAnimationMode
enumeration of from clutter_alpha_register_func().

All the properties specified will be animated between the current value
and the final value. If a property should be set at the beginning of
the animation but not updated during the animation, it should be prefixed
by the &quot;fixed::&quot; string, for instance:

|[
clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_SINE, 100,
&quot;rotation-angle-z&quot;, 360.0,
&quot;fixed::rotation-center-z&quot;, &amp;center,
NULL);
]|

Will animate the &quot;rotation-angle-z&quot; property between the current value
and 360 degrees, and set the &quot;rotation-center-z&quot; property to the fixed
value of the #ClutterVertex &quot;center&quot;.

This function will implicitly create a #ClutterAnimation object which
will be assigned to the @actor and will be returned to the developer
to control the animation or to know when the animation has been
completed.

If a name argument starts with &quot;signal::&quot;, &quot;signal-after::&quot;,
&quot;signal-swapped::&quot; or &quot;signal-swapped-after::&quot; the two following arguments
are used as callback function and data for a signal handler installed on
the #ClutterAnimation object for the specified signal name, for instance:

|[

static void
on_animation_completed (ClutterAnimation *animation,
ClutterActor     *actor)
{
clutter_actor_hide (actor);
}

clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC, 100,
&quot;opacity&quot;, 0,
&quot;signal::completed&quot;, on_animation_completed, actor,
NULL);
]|

or, to automatically destroy an actor at the end of the animation:

|[
clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC, 100,
&quot;opacity&quot;, 0,
&quot;signal-swapped-after::completed&quot;,
clutter_actor_destroy,
actor,
NULL);
]|

The &quot;signal::&quot; modifier is the equivalent of using g_signal_connect();
the &quot;signal-after::&quot; modifier is the equivalent of using
g_signal_connect_after() or g_signal_connect_data() with the
%G_CONNECT_AFTER; the &quot;signal-swapped::&quot; modifier is the equivalent
of using g_signal_connect_swapped() or g_signal_connect_data() with the
%G_CONNECT_SWAPPED flah; finally, the &quot;signal-swapped-after::&quot; modifier
is the equivalent of using g_signal_connect_data() with both the
%G_CONNECT_AFTER and %G_CONNECT_SWAPPED flags. The clutter_actor_animate()
function will not keep track of multiple connections to the same signal,
so it is your responsability to avoid them when calling
clutter_actor_animate() multiple times on the same actor.

Calling this function on an actor that is already being animated
will cause the current animation to change with the new final values,
the new easing mode and the new duration - that is, this code:

|[
clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 250,
&quot;width&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;height&quot;, 100.0,
NULL);
clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC, 500,
&quot;x&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;y&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;width&quot;, 200.0,
NULL);
]|

is the equivalent of:

|[
clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC, 500,
&quot;x&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;y&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;width&quot;, 200.0,
&quot;height&quot;, 100.0,
NULL);
]|

&lt;note&gt;Unless the animation is looping, the #ClutterAnimation created by
clutter_actor_animate() will become invalid as soon as it is
complete.&lt;/note&gt;

Since the created #ClutterAnimation instance attached to @actor
is guaranteed to be valid throughout the #ClutterAnimation::completed
signal emission chain, you will not be able to create a new animation
using clutter_actor_animate() on the same @actor from within the
#ClutterAnimation::completed signal handler unless you use
g_signal_connect_after() to connect the callback function, for instance:

|[
static void
on_animation_completed (ClutterAnimation *animation,
ClutterActor     *actor)
{
clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_OUT_CUBIC, 250,
&quot;x&quot;, 500.0,
&quot;y&quot;, 500.0,
NULL);
}

...
animation = clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC, 250,
&quot;x&quot;, 100.0,
&quot;y&quot;, 100.0,
NULL);
g_signal_connect (animation, &quot;completed&quot;,
G_CALLBACK (on_animation_completed),
actor);
...
]|

<function name="clutter_actor_destroy_all_children">
<description>
Destroys all children of @self.

This function releases the reference added by inserting a child
actor in the list of children of @self, and ensures that the
#ClutterActor::destroy signal is emitted on each child of the
actor.

By default, #ClutterActor will emit the #ClutterActor::destroy signal
when its reference count drops to 0; the default handler of the
#ClutterActor::destroy signal will destroy all the children of an
actor. This function ensures that all children are destroyed, instead
of just removed from @self, unlike clutter_actor_remove_all_children()
which will merely release the reference and remove each child.

Unless you acquired an additional reference on each child of @self
prior to calling clutter_actor_remove_all_children() and want to reuse
the actors, you should use clutter_actor_destroy_all_children() in
order to make sure that children are destroyed and signal handlers
are disconnected even in cases where circular references prevent this
from automatically happening through reference counting alone.

This function tries to &quot;do what you mean&quot; and tell you where the
actor is, prior to any transformations. Retrieves the fixed
position of an actor in pixels, if one has been set; otherwise, if
the allocation is valid, returns the actor's allocated position;
otherwise, returns 0,0.

The returned position is in pixels.

<description>
Computes the preferred minimum and natural size of an actor, taking into

or width-for-height).

The width and height used to compute the preferred height and preferred
width are the actor's natural ones.

If you need to control the height for the preferred width, or the width for
the preferred height, you should use clutter_actor_get_preferred_width()
and clutter_actor_get_preferred_height(), and check the actor's preferred
geometry management using the #ClutterActor:request-mode property.

This function will be used by Clutter to toggle an &quot;internal child&quot;

are handled differently by Clutter, specifically when destroying their
parent.

Call clutter_actor_pop_internal() when you finished adding internal

<function name="clutter_actor_queue_redraw">
<description>
Queues up a redraw of an actor and any children. The redraw occurs
once the main loop becomes idle (after the current batch of events
has been processed, roughly).

Applications rarely need to call this, as redraws are handled
automatically by modification functions.

This function will not do anything if @self is not visible, or
if the actor is inside an invisible part of the scenegraph.

Also be aware that painting is a NOP for actors with an opacity of
0

When you are implementing a custom actor you must queue a redraw
whenever some private state changes that will affect painting or
picking of your actor.

<function name="clutter_actor_realize">
<description>
Realization informs the actor that it is attached to a stage. It
can use this to allocate resources if it wanted to delay allocation
until it would be rendered. However it is perfectly acceptable for
an actor to create resources before being realized because Clutter
only ever has a single rendering context so that actor is free to
be moved from one stage to another.

This function does nothing if the actor is already realized.

Because a realized actor must have realized parent actors, calling
clutter_actor_realize() will also realize all parents of the actor.

This function does not realize child actors, except in the special
case that realizing the stage, when the stage is visible, will
suddenly map (and thus realize) the children of the stage.

Deprecated: 1.16: Actors are automatically realized, and nothing
requires explicit realization.

<function name="clutter_actor_reparent">
<description>
Resets the parent actor of @self.

This function is logically equivalent to calling clutter_actor_unparent()
and clutter_actor_set_parent(), but more efficiently implemented, as it
ensures the child is not finalized when unparented, and emits the
#ClutterActor::parent-set signal only once.

In reality, calling this function is less useful than it sounds, as some
application code may rely on changes in the intermediate state between
removal and addition of the actor from its old parent to the @new_parent.
Thus, it is strongly encouraged to avoid using this function in application
code.

Since: 0.2

Deprecated: 1.10: Use clutter_actor_remove_child() and
clutter_actor_add_child() instead; remember to take a reference on
the actor being removed before calling clutter_actor_remove_child()
to avoid the reference count dropping to zero and the actor being
destroyed.

<function name="clutter_actor_set_allocation">
<description>
Stores the allocation of @self as defined by @box.

This function can only be called from within the implementation of
the #ClutterActorClass.allocate() virtual function.

The allocation should have been adjusted to take into account constraints,
alignment, and margin properties. If you are implementing a #ClutterActor
subclass that provides its own layout management policy for its children
instead of using a #ClutterLayoutManager delegate, you should not call
this function on the children of @self; instead, you should call
clutter_actor_allocate(), which will adjust the allocation box for
you.

This function should only be used by subclasses of #ClutterActor
that wish to store their allocation but cannot chain up to the
parent's implementation; the default implementation of the
#ClutterActorClass.allocate() virtual function will call this
function.

It is important to note that, while chaining up was the recommended
behaviour for #ClutterActor subclasses prior to the introduction of
this function, it is recommended to call clutter_actor_set_allocation()
instead.

If the #ClutterActor is using a #ClutterLayoutManager delegate object
to handle the allocation of its children, this function will call
the clutter_layout_manager_allocate() function only if the
%CLUTTER_DELEGATE_LAYOUT flag is set on @flags, otherwise it is
expected that the subclass will call clutter_layout_manager_allocate()
by itself. For instance, the following code:

|[
static void
my_actor_allocate (ClutterActor *actor,
const ClutterActorBox *allocation,
ClutterAllocationFlags flags)
{
ClutterActorBox new_alloc;
ClutterAllocationFlags new_flags;

adjust_allocation (allocation, &amp;new_alloc);

new_flags = flags | CLUTTER_DELEGATE_LAYOUT;

/ * this will use the layout manager set on the actor * /
clutter_actor_set_allocation (actor, &amp;new_alloc, new_flags);
}
]|

is equivalent to this:

|[
static void
my_actor_allocate (ClutterActor *actor,
const ClutterActorBox *allocation,
ClutterAllocationFlags flags)
{
ClutterLayoutManager *layout;
ClutterActorBox new_alloc;

adjust_allocation (allocation, &amp;new_alloc);

clutter_actor_set_allocation (actor, &amp;new_alloc, flags);

layout = clutter_actor_get_layout_manager (actor);
clutter_layout_manager_allocate (layout,
CLUTTER_CONTAINER (actor),
&amp;new_alloc,
flags);
}

<function name="clutter_actor_set_offscreen_redirect">
<description>
Defines the circumstances where the actor should be redirected into
an offscreen image. The offscreen image is used to flatten the
actor into a single image while painting for two main reasons.
Firstly, when the actor is painted a second time without any of its
contents changing it can simply repaint the cached image without
descending further down the actor hierarchy. Secondly, it will make
the opacity look correct even if there are overlapping primitives
in the actor.

Caching the actor could in some cases be a performance win and in
some cases be a performance lose so it is important to determine
which value is right for an actor before modifying this value. For
example, there is never any reason to flatten an actor that is just
a single texture (such as a #ClutterTexture) because it is
effectively already cached in an image so the offscreen would be
redundant. Also if the actor contains primitives that are far apart
with a large transparent area in the middle (such as a large
CluterGroup with a small actor in the top left and a small actor in
the bottom right) then the cached image will contain the entire
image of the large area and the paint will waste time blending all
of the transparent pixels in the middle.

The default method of implementing opacity on a container simply
forwards on the opacity to all of the children. If the children are
overlapping then it will appear as if they are two separate glassy
objects and there will be a break in the color where they
overlap. By redirecting to an offscreen buffer it will be as if the
two opaque objects are combined into one and then made transparent
which is usually what is expected.

The image below demonstrates the difference between redirecting and
not. The image shows two Clutter groups, each containing a red and
a green rectangle which overlap. The opacity on the group is set to
128 (which is 50%). When the offscreen redirect is not used, the
red rectangle can be seen through the blue rectangle as if the two
rectangles were separately transparent. When the redirect is used
the group as a whole is transparent instead so the red rectangle is
not visible where they overlap.

&lt;figure id=&quot;offscreen-redirect&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Sample of using an offscreen redirect for transparency&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;graphic fileref=&quot;offscreen-redirect.png&quot; format=&quot;PNG&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

The default value for this property is 0, so we effectively will
never redirect an actor offscreen by default. This means that there
are times that transparent actors may look glassy as described
above. The reason this is the default is because there is a
performance trade off between quality and performance here. In many
cases the default form of glassy opacity looks good enough, but if
it's not you will need to set the
%CLUTTER_OFFSCREEN_REDIRECT_AUTOMATIC_FOR_OPACITY flag to enable
redirection for opacity.

Custom actors that don't contain any overlapping primitives are
recommended to override the has_overlaps() virtual to return %FALSE
for maximum efficiency.

The conversion can fail, notably if the transform stack results in the
actor being projected on the screen as a mere line.

The conversion should not be expected to be pixel-perfect due to the
nature of the operation. In general the error grows when the skewing
of the actor rectangle on screen increases.

<function name="clutter_actor_unrealize">
<description>
Unrealization informs the actor that it may be being destroyed or
moved to another stage. The actor may want to destroy any
underlying graphics resources at this point. However it is
perfectly acceptable for it to retain the resources until the actor
is destroyed because Clutter only ever uses a single rendering
context and all of the graphics resources are valid on any stage.

Because mapped actors must be realized, actors may not be
unrealized if they are mapped. This function hides the actor to be
sure it isn't mapped, an application-visible side effect that you
may not be expecting.

This function should not be called by application code.

This function should not really be in the public API, because
there isn't a good reason to call it. ClutterActor will already
unrealize things for you when it's important to do so.

If you were using clutter_actor_unrealize() in a dispose
implementation, then don't, just chain up to ClutterActor's
dispose.

If you were using clutter_actor_unrealize() to implement
unrealizing children of your container, then don't, ClutterActor

specified, can only be a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

In the hls() and hlsa() formats, the 'h' value (hue) is an angle between
0 and 360.0 degrees; the 'l' and 's' values (luminance and saturation) are
percentage values in the range between 0% and 100%. The 'a' value, if specified,
can only be a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

Whitespace inside the definitions is ignored; no leading whitespace
is allowed.

<function name="clutter_effect_queue_repaint">
<description>
Queues a repaint of the effect. The effect can detect when the ‘paint’
method is called as a result of this function because it will not
have the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY flag set. In that case the
effect is free to assume that the actor has not changed its
appearance since the last time it was painted so it doesn't need to
call clutter_actor_continue_paint() if it can draw a cached
image. This is mostly intended for effects that are using a
%CoglOffscreen to redirect the actor (such as
%ClutterOffscreenEffect). In that case the effect can save a bit of
rendering time by painting the cached texture without causing the
entire actor to be painted.

This function can be used by effects that have their own animatable
parameters. For example, an effect which adds a varying degree of a
red tint to an actor by redirecting it through a CoglOffscreen
might have a property to specify the level of tint. When this value
changes, the underlying actor doesn't need to be redrawn so the
effect can call clutter_effect_queue_repaint() to make sure the
effect is repainted.

Note however that modifying the position of the parent of an actor
may change the appearance of the actor because its transformation
matrix would change. In this case a redraw wouldn't be queued on
the actor itself so the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY would still
not be set. The effect can detect this case by keeping track of the
last modelview matrix that was used to render the actor and
veryifying that it remains the same in the next paint.

Any other effects that are layered on top of the passed in effect
will still be passed the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY flag. If
anything queues a redraw on the actor without specifying an effect
or with an effect that is lower in the chain of effects than this
one then that will override this call. In that case this effect
will instead be called with the %CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY
flag set.

Sets a function to be called at regular intervals with the given

%FALSE, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and

called when the timeout is destroyed.  The first call to the
function will be at the end of the first @interval.

This function is similar to g_timeout_add_full() except that it
will try to compensate for delays. For example, if @func takes half
the interval time to execute then the function will be called again
half the interval time after it finished. In contrast
g_timeout_add_full() would not fire until a full interval after the
function completes so the delay between calls would be 1.0 / @fps *
1.5. This function does not however try to invoke the function
multiple times to catch up missing frames if @func takes more than
@interval ms to execute.

<function name="clutter_init">
<description>
Initialises everything needed to operate with Clutter and parses some
standard command line options; @argc and @argv are adjusted accordingly
so your own code will never see those standard arguments.

It is safe to call this function multiple times.

&lt;note&gt;This function will not abort in case of errors during
initialization; clutter_init() will print out the error message on
stderr, and will return an error code. It is up to the application
code to handle this case. If you need to display the error message
yourself, you can use clutter_init_with_args(), which takes a #GError
pointer.&lt;/note&gt;

If this function fails, and returns an error code, any subsequent
Clutter API will have undefined behaviour - including segmentation
faults and assertion failures. Make sure to handle the returned
#ClutterInitError enumeration value.

<function name="clutter_init_with_args">
<description>
This function does the same work as clutter_init(). Additionally,
it allows you to add your own command line options, and it
automatically generates nicely formatted &lt;option&gt;--help&lt;/option&gt;
output. Note that your program will be terminated after writing
out the help output. Also note that, in case of error, the
error message will be placed inside @error instead of being
printed on the display.

Just like clutter_init(), if this function returns an error code then
any subsequent call to any other Clutter API will result in undefined
behaviour - including segmentation faults.

<function name="clutter_input_device_update_from_event">
<description>
Forcibly updates the state of the @device using a #ClutterEvent

This function should never be used by applications: it is meant
for integration with embedding toolkits, like clutter-gtk

Embedding toolkits that disable the event collection inside Clutter
need to use this function to update the state of input devices depending
on a #ClutterEvent that they are going to submit to the event handling code
in Clutter though clutter_do_event(). Since the input devices hold the state
that is going to be used to fill in fields like the #ClutterButtonEvent
click count, or to emit synthesized events like %CLUTTER_ENTER and
%CLUTTER_LEAVE, it is necessary for embedding toolkits to also be
responsible of updating the input device state.

For instance, this might be the code to translate an embedding toolkit
native motion notification into a Clutter #ClutterMotionEvent and ask
Clutter to process it:

|[
ClutterEvent c_event;

translate_native_event_to_clutter (native_event, &amp;c_event);

clutter_do_event (&amp;c_event);
]|

Before letting clutter_do_event() process the event, it is necessary to call
clutter_input_device_update_from_event():

|[
ClutterEvent c_event;
ClutterDeviceManager *manager;
ClutterInputDevice *device;

translate_native_event_to_clutter (native_event, &amp;c_event);

/ * get the device manager * /
manager = clutter_device_manager_get_default ();

/ * use the default Core Pointer that Clutter
* backends register by default
* /
device = clutter_device_manager_get_core_device (manager, %CLUTTER_POINTER_DEVICE);

/ * update the state of the input device * /
clutter_input_device_update_from_event (device, &amp;c_event, FALSE);

clutter_do_event (&amp;c_event);
]|

The @update_stage boolean argument should be used when the input device
enters and leaves a #ClutterStage; it will use the #ClutterStage field
of the passed @event to update the stage associated to the input device.

<function name="clutter_path_add_string">
<description>
Adds new nodes to the end of the path as described in @str. The
format is a subset of the SVG path format. Each node is represented
by a letter and is followed by zero, one or three pairs of
coordinates. The coordinates can be separated by spaces or a
comma. The types are:

&lt;variablelist&gt;
&lt;varlistentry&gt;&lt;term&gt;M&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;
Adds a %CLUTTER_PATH_MOVE_TO node. Takes one pair of coordinates.
&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/varlistentry&gt;
&lt;varlistentry&gt;&lt;term&gt;L&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;
Adds a %CLUTTER_PATH_LINE_TO node. Takes one pair of coordinates.

&lt;varlistentry&gt;&lt;term&gt;C&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;
Adds a %CLUTTER_PATH_CURVE_TO node. Takes three pairs of coordinates.
&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/varlistentry&gt;
&lt;varlistentry&gt;&lt;term&gt;z&lt;/term&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;
Adds a %CLUTTER_PATH_CLOSE node. No coordinates are needed.
&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/varlistentry&gt;
&lt;/variablelist&gt;

The M, L and C commands can also be specified in lower case which
means the coordinates are relative to the previous node.

For example, to move an actor in a 100 by 100 pixel square centered
on the point 300,300 you could use the following path:

&lt;informalexample&gt;
&lt;programlisting&gt;
M 250,350 l 0 -100 L 350,250 l 0 100 z
&lt;/programlisting&gt;

If the path description isn't valid %FALSE will be returned and no
nodes will be added.

<function name="clutter_stage_set_fog">
<description>
Sets the fog (also known as &quot;depth cueing&quot;) settings for the @stage.

A #ClutterStage will only use a linear fog progression, which
depends solely on the distance from the viewer. The cogl_set_fog()
function in COGL exposes more of the underlying implementation,
and allows changing the for progression function. It can be directly
used by disabling the #ClutterStage:use-fog property and connecting
a signal handler to the #ClutterActor::paint signal on the @stage,
like:

|[
clutter_stage_set_use_fog (stage, FALSE);
g_signal_connect (stage, &quot;paint&quot;, G_CALLBACK (on_stage_paint), NULL);
]|

The paint signal handler will call cogl_set_fog() with the
desired settings:

|[
static void
on_stage_paint (ClutterActor *actor)
{
ClutterColor stage_color = { 0, };
CoglColor fog_color = { 0, };

/ * set the fog color to the stage background color * /
clutter_stage_get_color (CLUTTER_STAGE (actor), &amp;stage_color);
cogl_color_init_from_4ub (&amp;fog_color,
stage_color.red,
stage_color.green,
stage_color.blue,
stage_color.alpha);

/ * enable fog * /
cogl_set_fog (&amp;fog_color,
COGL_FOG_MODE_EXPONENTIAL, / * mode * /
0.5,                       / * density * /
5.0, 30.0);                / * z_near and z_far * /
}
]|

&lt;note&gt;The fogging functions only work correctly when the visible actors use
unmultiplied alpha colors. By default Cogl will premultiply textures and
cogl_set_source_color() will premultiply colors, so unless you explicitly
load your textures requesting an unmultiplied internal format and use
cogl_material_set_color() you can only use fogging with fully opaque actors.
Support for premultiplied colors will improve in the future when we can
depend on fragment shaders.&lt;/note&gt;

events) should be disabled or not.

The default is %TRUE.

If @enable is %FALSE the following events will not be delivered
to the actors children of @stage.

&lt;itemizedlist&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;#ClutterActor::motion-event&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;#ClutterActor::enter-event&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;#ClutterActor::leave-event&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;

The events will still be delivered to the #ClutterStage.

The main side effect of this function is that disabling the motion
events will disable picking to detect the #ClutterActor underneath
the pointer for each motion event. This is useful, for instance,
when dragging a #ClutterActor across the @stage: the actor underneath
the pointer is not going to change, so it's meaningless to perform
a pick.

Sets whether the @stage should clear itself at the beginning

Clearing the #ClutterStage can be a costly operation, especially
if the stage is always covered - for instance, in a full-screen
video player or in a game with a background texture.

&lt;note&gt;&lt;para&gt;This setting is a hint; Clutter might discard this
hint depending on its internal state.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/note&gt;

clearing you might end up with visual artifacts while painting the

<function name="clutter_stage_set_sync_delay">
<description>
This function enables an alternate behavior where Clutter draws at
a fixed point in time after the frame presentation time (also known
as the VBlank time). This is most useful when the application
wants to show incoming data with predictable latency. (The primary
example of this would be a window system compositor.) By synchronizing
to provide new data before Clutter redraws, an external source of
updates (in the compositor, an application) can get a reliable latency.

The appropriate value of @sync_delay depends on the complexity of
drawing the stage's scene graph - in general a value of between 0
and 8 ms (up to one-half of a typical 60hz frame rate) is appropriate.
using a larger value will reduce latency but risks skipping a frame if
drawing the stage takes too long.

<description>
Adds multiple keys to a named state of a #ClutterState instance, specifying
the easing mode and value a given property of an object should have at a
given progress of the animation.

The mode specified is the easing mode used when going to from the previous
key to the specified key.

For instance, the code below:

|[
clutter_state_set (state, NULL, &quot;hover&quot;,
button, &quot;opacity&quot;, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 255,
button, &quot;scale-x&quot;, CLUTTER_EASE_OUT_CUBIC, 1.2,
button, &quot;scale-y&quot;, CLUTTER_EASE_OUT_CUBIC, 1.2,
NULL);
]|

will create a transition from any state (a @source_state_name or NULL is
treated as a wildcard) and a state named &quot;hover&quot;; the
&lt;emphasis&gt;button&lt;/emphasis&gt; object will have the #ClutterActor:opacity
property animated to a value of 255 using %CLUTTER_LINEAR as the animation
mode, and the #ClutterActor:scale-x and #ClutterActor:scale-y properties
animated to a value of 1.2 using %CLUTTER_EASE_OUT_CUBIC as the animation
mode. To change the state (and start the transition) you can use the
clutter_state_set_state() function:

|[
clutter_state_set_state (state, &quot;hover&quot;);
]|

If a given object, state_name, property tuple already exist in the
#ClutterState instance, then the mode and value will be replaced with
the new specified values.

If a property name is prefixed with &quot;delayed::&quot; two additional
arguments per key are expected: a value relative to the full state time
to pause before transitioning and a similar value to pause after
transitioning, e.g.:

|[
clutter_state_set (state, &quot;hover&quot;, &quot;toggled&quot;,
button, &quot;delayed::scale-x&quot;, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 1.0, 0.2, 0.2,
button, &quot;delayed::scale-y&quot;, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 1.0, 0.2, 0.2,
NULL);

<function name="clutter_texture_new_from_actor">
<description>
Creates a new #ClutterTexture object with its source a prexisting
actor (and associated children). The textures content will contain
'live' redirected output of the actors scene.

Note this function is intented as a utility call for uniformly applying
shaders to groups and other potential visual effects. It requires that
the %CLUTTER_FEATURE_OFFSCREEN feature is supported by the current backend
and the target system.

Some tips on usage:

&lt;itemizedlist&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;The source actor must be made visible (i.e by calling
#clutter_actor_show).&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;The source actor must have a parent in order for it to be
allocated a size from the layouting mechanism. If the source
actor does not have a parent when this function is called then
the ClutterTexture will adopt it and allocate it at its
preferred size. Using this you can clone an actor that is
otherwise not displayed. Because of this feature if you do
intend to display the source actor then you must make sure that
the actor is parented before calling
clutter_texture_new_from_actor() or that you unparent it before
adding it to a container.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;When getting the image for the clone texture, Clutter
will attempt to render the source actor exactly as it would
appear if it was rendered on screen. The source actor's parent
transformations are taken into account. Therefore if your
source actor is rotated along the X or Y axes so that it has
some depth, the texture will appear differently depending on
the on-screen location of the source actor. While painting the
source actor, Clutter will set up a temporary asymmetric
perspective matrix as the projection matrix so that the source
actor will be projected as if a small section of the screen was
being viewed. Before version 0.8.2, an orthogonal identity
projection was used which meant that the source actor would be
clipped if any part of it was not on the zero Z-plane.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;Avoid reparenting the source with the created texture.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;A group can be padded with a transparent rectangle as to
provide a border to contents for shader output (blurring text
for example).&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;The texture will automatically resize to contain a further
transformed source. However, this involves overhead and can be
avoided by placing the source actor in a bounding group
sized large enough to contain any child tranformations.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;Uploading pixel data to the texture (e.g by using
clutter_texture_set_from_file()) will destroy the offscreen texture
data and end redirection.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;listitem&gt;
&lt;para&gt;cogl_texture_get_data() with the handle returned by
clutter_texture_get_cogl_texture() can be used to read the
offscreen texture pixels into a pixbuf.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/listitem&gt;
&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;

Adds a function to be called whenever there are no higher priority

removed from the list of event sources and will not be called again.

This function can be considered a thread-safe variant of g_idle_add_full():
it will call @function while holding the Clutter lock. It is logically
equivalent to the following implementation:

|[
static gboolean
idle_safe_callback (gpointer data)
{
SafeClosure *closure = data;
gboolean res = FALSE;

clutter_threads_enter();

/ * the callback does not need to acquire the Clutter

closure-&gt;data = data;

return g_idle_add_full (G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE,
idle_safe_callback,
closure,
g_free)
}
]|

This function should be used by threaded applications to make sure
that @func is emitted under the Clutter threads lock and invoked
from the same thread that started the Clutter main loop. For instance,
it can be used to update the UI using the results from a worker
thread:

|[

update_ui (gpointer data)

SomeClosure *closure = data;

/ * it is safe to call Clutter API from this function because
* it is invoked from the same thread that started the main

<function name="clutter_threads_add_repaint_func">
<description>
Adds a function to be called whenever Clutter is processing a new

If the function returns %FALSE it is automatically removed from the
list of repaint functions and will not be called again.

This function is guaranteed to be called from within the same thread
that called clutter_main(), and while the Clutter lock is being held;
the function will be called within the main loop, so it is imperative
that it does not block, otherwise the frame time budget may be lost.

A repaint function is useful to ensure that an update of the scenegraph
is performed before the scenegraph is repainted; for instance, uploading
a frame from a video into a #ClutterTexture. By default, a repaint
function added using this function will be invoked prior to the frame
being processed.

Adding a repaint function does not automatically ensure that a new
frame will be queued.

When the repaint function is removed (either because it returned %FALSE
or because clutter_threads_remove_repaint_func() has been called) the
@notify function will be called, if any is set.

Allows the application to replace the standard method that

application provides, instead, a function @enter_fn that is

The functions must provide at least same locking functionality
as the default implementation, but can also do extra application
specific processing.

As an example, consider an application that has its own recursive
lock that when held, holds the Clutter lock as well. When Clutter
unlocks the Clutter lock when entering a recursive main loop, the
application must temporarily release its lock as well.

Most threaded Clutter apps won't need to use this method.

<description>
Sets the final value of the transition.

This is a convenience function that will either create the
